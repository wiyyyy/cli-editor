## Cli-Editor

I have made this as my school project and it lack of advenced features. Yes there is bugs.
I put it here so people wont strugle searching how to write a text editor using linked list.

&#x2013; !! IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE IN REAL LIFE !! &#x2013;

This program allows you to edit a file or create a new one but it functions are very limited.
I know key bindings are not usual keys. But this program aims to be helpful to students
and give them general idea how to write linkedlist. 
For open and save files dialog i used tinyfiledialogs library. 
This program uses Doubly Linked list.
It uses ncurses library.
